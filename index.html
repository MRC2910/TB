<h1> <head><b><center> TUBERCULOSIS</center></b></h1>

<p><i><center> It is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, 
but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. 
As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB disease. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. </i></p></center>
<br>

<p><span class="style1">Latent TB Infection</p></span>

<p><span class="style2">TB bacteria can live in the body without making you sick. This is called latent TB infection. 
In most people who breathe in TB bacteria and become infected, the body is able to fight the bacteria to stop them from growing. 
People with latent TB infection: </p></span>


<p><span class="style3">• Have no symptoms </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• Don’t feel sick </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• Can’t spread TB bacteria to others </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• Usually have a positive TB skin test reaction or positive TB blood test </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• May develop TB disease if they do not receive treatment for latent TB infection </p></span>




<p><b><span class="style1">TB Disease </b><p></span>

<p><span class="style2"> TB bacteria become active if the immune system can’t stop them from growing. 
When TB bacteria are active (multiplying in your body), this is called TB disease. People with TB disease are sick. 
They may also be able to spread the bacteria to people they spend time with every day. </span></p>

<p><span class="style2">Many people who have latent TB infection never develop TB disease. 
Some people develop TB disease soon after becoming infected (within weeks) before their immune system can fight the TB bacteria. 
Other people may get sick years later when their immune system becomes weak for another reason.</p></span> 

<p><span class="style2"> For people whose immune systems are weak, especially those with HIV infection, 
the risk of developing TB disease is much higher than for people with normal immune systems.</p></span>


<p><span class="style3"> • Has symptoms </p></span>
<p><span class="style3"> • Usually feels sick </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• May spread TB bacteria to others <p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• Usually has a skin test or blood test result indicating TB infection </p></span>
<p><span class="style3"> • May have an abnormal chest x-ray, or positive sputum smear or culture </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• Needs treatment to treat TB disease <p></span>

<p><b><center><span class="style1">Signs & Symptoms </center></b></p><span>

<p><span class="style2">  TB disease in the lungs may cause symptoms such as: </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•a bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•pain in the chest </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•coughing up blood or sputum <p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•weakness or fatigue </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•weight loss </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•no appetite </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•chills </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•fever </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•sweating at night </p></span>

<br>
<p><b><center><span class="style1"> Testing & Diagnosis </center></b><p><span>
<p><b><span class="style1">Testing </b><p></span>
<p><span class="style2">There are two kinds of tests used to detect TB bacteria in the body: the TB skin test (TST) and TB blood tests. 
A positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria. 
It does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection (LTBI) or has progressed to TB disease. 
Other tests, such as a chest x-ray and a sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease. <p></span>

<p><b><span class="style1">Diagnosis</b><p></span>

<p><span class="style2"><b>If a person is infected with TB bacteria, other tests are needed to see if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease.
</b></p></span>
<p><span class="style4">Listening to you breathe with a stethoscope.</span>
<p><span class="style4">Checking for swollen lymph nodes.</span>
<p><span class="style4">Asking you questions about your symptoms.</span>
<p><span class="style4">Your health care provider will order tests if:</span>
<p><span class="style4">Tuberculosis is suspected.</span>
<p><span class="style4">You were likely exposed to a person with active tuberculosis (TB) disease.</span>
<p><span class="style4">Your provider will determine whether a skin test or blood test is the best option.</span>
<p><span class="style2">•Skin test</span>
<p><span class="style2">A tiny amount of a substance called tuberculin is injected just below the skin on the inside of one forearm. 
Within 48 to 72 hours, a health care worker will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. 
The size of the raised skin is used to determine a positive or negative test. This test is seeing if your immune system reacts, or has made an antibody, 
to tuberculosis. A positive test indicates you likely have either a latent TB infection or active TB disease. 
People who had a TB vaccination might get a positive test even if they have no infection. A negative test means that your body didn’t react to the test. 
It doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t have an infection.</span>
<p><span class="style2">•Blood tests</span>
<p><span class="style2">A sample of blood is sent to a lab. One lab test finds out whether certain immune system cells can “recognize” tuberculosis. 
A positive test shows that you have either a latent TB infection or active TB disease. Other tests of the blood sample can help determine if you have active disease. 
A negative result means you likely do not have a TB infection.</span>
<p><span class="style2">•X-ray</span>
<p><span class="style2">A chest X-ray can show irregular patches in the lungs that are typical of active TB disease.</span>
<p><span class="style2">•Sputum tests</span>
<p><span class="style2">Your health care provider may take a sample of the mucus that comes up when you cough, also called sputum. 
If you have active TB disease in your lungs or voice box, lab tests can detect the bacteria. 
A relatively quick laboratory test can tell if the sputum likely has the TB bacteria. But it may be showing bacteria with similar features.
<p><span class="style2">• Other lab tests that may be ordered include:</span>
<p><span class="style4">-Breath test.</span>
<p><span class="style4">-Procedure to remove sputum from your lungs with a special tube.</span>
<p><span class="style4">-Urine test.</span>
<p><span class="style4">-Test of the fluid around the spine and brain, called cerebrospinal fluid.</span>


<p><b><span class="style1">How it spreads?</b><p></span>
<p><span class="style2">TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. 
A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.
People infected with TB bacteria have a lifetime risk of falling ill with TB of 10%. However persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, 
malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill.</span></p>

<p><b><span class="style1">How long is TB contagious?</b><p></span>
<p><span class="style2">Most people may remain at home, but all should be kept from any new contacts for at least 2 weeks after treatment begins. 
The elderly and those who are acutely ill or have multidrug resistant TB should be hospitalized for the first few weeks of treatment.</span></p>


<p><span class="style1"> Prevention </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">• Having a healthy immune system is the best form of defence against TB: 60% of adults with a healthy </span>
immune system can completely kill TB bacteria.</span>
<p><span class="style3">• There is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) called the BCG vaccine.</span>
<p><span class="style3">• As TB is an airborne infection, TB bacteria are released into the air when someone with infectious TB coughs or sneezes. </span>
The risk of infection can be reduced by using a few simple precautions:</span>

<p><span class="style4">Good ventilation: as TB can remain suspended in the air for several hours with no ventilation</span>
<p><span class="style4">Natural light: UV light kills off TB bacteria</span>
<p><span class="style4">Good hygiene: covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing reduces the spread of TB bacteria.</span>

<p><span class="style3">In healthcare settings, the spread of TB is reduced through the use of protective masks, ventilation systems, 
keeping potentially infectious patients separate from other patients, and the regular screening of healthcare workers for TB.</span>

<p><span class="style1"> Treatment </p></span>
<p><span class="style3">•Rifampin</span>
<p><span class="style3">•Isoniazid</span>
<p><span class="style3">•Pyrazinamide</span>
<p><span class="style3">•Ethambutol</span>
<p><span class="style3">•Streptomycin</span>

<p><span class="style3">The RIPES are first-line antitubercular medications, which are FDA-approved and indicated for the treatment 
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.<br> RIPE regimens for treating TB disease have an intensive phase of 2 months, 
followed by a continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months (total of 6 to 9 months for treatment). 
This is the preferred regimen for patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB..</span>
